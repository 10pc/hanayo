# Hanayo

Ripple's messy frontend. https://ripple.moe

This repository has a mirror at https://github.com/osuripple/hanayo. The original repo is still at https://zxq.co/ripple/hanayo.

Hanayo was developed with the initial intention of it having very little Go code, so it was all in the main package. I underestimated the quantity of Go code I would have required for it, and it eventually grew into an unmanageable beast.
