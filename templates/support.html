					of our own pockets, 1. we would be broke, 2. we wouldn't be
					able to upgrade our hardware to accomodate our users. While we
					do have loads of software optimisations that allow us to have
					Ripple run crazy fast while still being on not so high-end
					hardware, the more users we have, the higher-end our hardware
					needs to be. So we are asking you for help on this :).

				<div class="row">
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Yellow username</h3>
						Just like in osu!, you get a <b>shiny yellow username</b> in the in-game chat to show everyone you're a really cool dude
						who has helped us pay the server bills.
					</div>
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Donor badge</h3>
						Again, just like in osu!, you will get a <b>donor badge</b> on your profile, to show everyone you're supporting us.
					</div>
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Custom badge editor</h3>
						You get to be able to create your <b>own personal badge</b>, with custom text and icon, to show off on your profile!
						Let the world know you're an anchor. Or prank people showing a spinnin' wheel with "Loading..."! Up to you.
					</div>
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Friends ranking</h3>
						<b>Competing with friends</b> is really cool, you can play on the leaderboard with someone more or less on your level,
						without getting crippling depression and RSI for not beating that pro!
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Discord privileges</h3>
						You'll get exclusive access to the <b>"#donators"</b> text and voice channels, you'll be able to change your discord
						nickname and you'll get a custom role with custom username colour!
					</div>
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">Profile background</h3>
						Think about <b>spicing your profile up with some eggplants</b>? Got you covered! Having donor privileges, you get to be able
						to change your profile background.
					</div>
					<div class="four wide column">
						<h3 class="ui header">More to come!</h3>
						<b>Who knows</b> what we could implement next? You could be able to do even <i>more</i> stuff for donors once we implement
